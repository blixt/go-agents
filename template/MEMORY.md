# MEMORY.md

Curated long-term memory. This file is injected into your system prompt automatically.

Keep it focused: stable decisions, active constraints, lessons learned, user preferences. Remove entries when they go stale.

Daily notes live in memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md — review them periodically and distill what matters here.

Do not store secrets.
